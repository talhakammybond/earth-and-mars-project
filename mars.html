        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. </p>

        <p>In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the <em>Red Planet</em> because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #d33d1f;">Orbit and rotation</h2>
        <h3>Rotation</h3>
        <p>Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million km (143 million mi), and its orbital period is 687 <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>  days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.</p>

        <p>The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees relative to its orbital plane, which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.</p>
