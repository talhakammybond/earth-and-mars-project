# 3 Page Website

## Practice Time - HTML & CSS Crash Course on Scrimba

In this lesson we're building a 3-page website about Earth and Mars. We'll create the three pages and link them all together and then add in a touch of CSS at the end.

I did read the .md files and have wrote the code on my own (No Cheating ðŸ˜‹).After completing I did checked the code by Mr. Powell and corrected some stuffs.
